# 1. Introduction

ATM is an electronic communication device that allows customers of financial institutions to directly engage in financial transactions such as cash withdrawals, deposits, fund transfers, books and account information at any time through bank employees.

We made a ATM system using Python 3.
We are working on this project to develop ATM to learn the same functions as cache memory, write clean codes, and think and grow with team members.
The ATM has created functions such as register, login, deposit, withdrawal, loan, transfer, balance inquiry, credit inquiry, customized recommendation system, etc.
To create these features, we implemented encryption, simple linear regression, and LRU cache memory to create more complete ATM.
